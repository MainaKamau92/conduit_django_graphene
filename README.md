> ### [Django GraphQL Api](https://github.com/MainaKamau92/conduit_django_graphene) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Django Graphene ]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Django Graphene]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works
**GraphQL**
> GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data
> Describe the general architecture of your app here

**Design Patterns(MVC):**

I mimicked the Django’s MVT pattern design for the API backend of the application, but would not be implementing the Template part of the design due to the nature of the backend implementation(API) but would opt for a Controllers part. I implemented an Object-Oriented approach as the coding convention. I used graphql in the place of a rest implementation and the views in the design are catered for by graphql mutations for the Create, Update and Delete and graphql queries for the Read/Retrieval/Get.
GraphQL has its own type system that’s used to define the schema of an API. More details about the GraphQL architecture can be found [here](https://graphql.org/learn/). 


# Getting started
# Project Title
## Conduit Django GraphQL Api 


# Prerequisites
For the web api to run locally a few requirements are necessary:
* Python 3 or newer
* virtualenv (For creating virtual environments and installing modules)
* All the listed dependencies in the **requirements.txt** file
* Git


## Getting Started
1.  Run the following command from your git command line tool

    * `git clone https://github.com/MainaKamau92/conduit_django_graphene.git`

    >> The command clones a local copy of the project folder to your local machine
2. Navigate into the folder that has been created and create a virtual environment and activate the virtual environment by running:
    * `virtualenv venv`

 >> Activate the virtual environment by keying on a unix based system  `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Run the migrations command to setup the database tables after installing the requirements in the requirements.txt
    * `python manage.py makemigrations` (this command should create a migrations folder)
    * `python manage.py migrate`


8. Run the `python manage.py runserver` command to start the application(it should ideally be served on your local address(`127.0.0.1:8000`) on port 8000)
9. You should get this response on running the application

    Django version 2.1.7, using settings 'django_rest_api.settings'
    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
    ```
6. The single endpoint generated by GraphQL -> `http://127.0.0.1:8000/conduit/`


## Working routes summary

> Find enclosed in the project folder an insonmia workspace json file that will help you set up all the queries and mutations of the api.
